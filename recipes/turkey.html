      When you're looking for something completely different to use up those
      turkey leftovers, this could be it! A tender, eggy pasta-like crepe
      enfolds the cheesy, amazing filling. You can make the crepes and filling
      ahead of time.

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup diced cooked turkey</li>
      <li>1 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups marinara sauce, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>⅓ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish, or
        as desired
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Whisk 2 eggs, flour, water, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon olive oil together
        thoroughly in a bowl to make a very smooth batter. Cover bowl with
        plastic wrap and refrigerate batter for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix turkey, ricotta cheese, 1 egg, 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese,
        mozzarella cheese, marjoram, red pepper flakes, and 1/4 cup Italian
        parsley in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Season with salt to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and brush generously with
        1 teaspoon olive oil or as needed. Swirl about 1/4 cup batter into the
        bottom of the pan and tilt to form a thin pancake covering the bottom of
        the skillet. Cook until bottom of crepe is dry, 60 to 90 seconds. Flip
        crepe and cook until other side has small browned spots, 60 to 90
        seconds more. Repeat with remaining batter to make 6 crepes. Transfer
        crepes to a plate as you make them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread about 1/2 cup marinara sauce into the bottom of a 9x12-inch
        baking dish. Use a brush to spread about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil in a
        thin layer up the sides of the dish. Place a crepe, dimpled side down,
        onto a work surface; spread about 1/3 to 1/2 cup filling onto crepe in a
        line down the middle. Roll crepe over filling and tuck in ends if
        desired. Lay filled crepe into the baking dish. Repeat with remaining
        crepes and filling to make 6 manicotti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread remaining 1 cup marinara sauce onto the manicotti in a line down
        the middle of the crepes, covering middle 1/3 of manicotti. Sprinkle 1/3
        cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese all over manicotti. Drizzle manicotti
        with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until manicotti are slightly browned and
        puffy, about 45 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes to cool. Garnish with 1
        tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or as desired and 1 tablespoon
        Italian parsley before serving.
