      Pasties are traditional meat pies hailing from the Upper Peninsula of
      Michigan! These are made with rutabaga so they're the real deal. Rub
      pasties with a little milk before baking if you want them to have a golden
      color.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 cup shortening</li>
      <li>1 cup cold water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound boneless round or chuck steak, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium carrot, diced (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ cup cubed rutabaga</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons margarine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in
        shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until
        dough comes together. Shape into a ball, wrap in plastic, and
        refrigerate for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the filling: Mix meat, potatoes, onion, carrot, rutabaga, salt, and
        pepper in a bowl until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove dough from the refrigerator and divide into six pieces. Shape
        pieces into balls, then roll into 6-inch diameter rounds on a lightly
        floured surface. Spread about 1 cup filling over half of each round and
        dot with 1 tablespoon margarine. Fold uncovered pastry up and over
        filling; crimp edges to seal. Prick with a fork and place onto the
        prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
